# ✅ Fixed: Exam Update Button

## Problem
The "Update Examination" button wasn't working when editing exams. Teachers couldn't save changes to existing exams.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Mismatched Form Field IDs**
**Problem:**
- JavaScript was looking for `editExamClass` and `editExamSubject`
- HTML had `examClass` and `examSubject`
- Field IDs didn't match!

**Fixed:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<select id="examClass" ...>
<select id="examSubject" ...>

<!-- AFTER -->
<select id="editExamClass" ...>
<select id="editExamSubject" ...>
```

### 2. **Class/Subject Dropdowns Not Loaded**
**Problem:**
- Edit modal opened with empty class/subject dropdowns
- Couldn't select or change class/subject

**Fixed:**
- Added `loadEditClasses()` function
- Added `loadEditSubjects()` function
- Auto-loads and pre-selects current values
- Allows changing to different class/subject

### 3. **No Dynamic Subject Loading**
**Problem:**
- Changing class didn't update subjects

**Fixed:**
- Added event listener for class change
- Automatically loads subjects when class changes
- Just like the create modal!

## What Was Changed

### File: `staff/exams.php`

#### 1. Fixed Form Field IDs
```html
Line 1020: <select id="editExamClass" ...>     (was: examClass)
Line 1029: <select id="editExamSubject" ...>   (was: examSubject)
```

#### 2. Updated `editExam()` Function
```javascript
// Now calls loadEditClasses() to populate dropdowns
loadEditClasses(exam.Class_ID, exam.Subject_ID);
```

#### 3. Added Helper Functions
```javascript
loadEditClasses(selectedClassId, selectedSubjectId)
  - Loads all classes
  - Pre-selects current class
  - Triggers subject loading

loadEditSubjects(classId, selectedSubjectId)
  - Loads subjects for selected class
  - Pre-selects current subject
  - Shows subject name and code
```

#### 4. Added Event Listener
```javascript
// Auto-load subjects when class changes in edit modal
editClassSelect.addEventListener('change', function() {
    loadEditSubjects(classId, null);
});
```
